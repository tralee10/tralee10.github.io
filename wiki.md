**Shoyu ramen** features a *clear, brown broth seasoned with soy sauce*, often accompanied by toppings like bamboo shoots, boiled eggs, and nori. It originates from Tokyo and is one of the most common varieties.
### Shio (Salt-Based)
**Shio ramen** is characterized by its *light and clear broth seasoned with salt*. Its delicate flavor profile is often complemented by seafood or chicken-based broths.
### Miso (Fermented Soybean Paste-Based)
**Miso ramen** boasts a creamy, rich broth made with fermented soybean paste. Popular in *Hokkaido*, it often includes corn, butter, and pork as toppings, reflecting the region's colder climate.
### Tonkotsu (Pork Bone-Based)
